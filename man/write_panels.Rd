\usage{
write_panels(trdf, width = 500, height = 500, format = "png", force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{trdf}{A trelliscope data frame created with \code{\link[=as_trelliscope]{as_trelliscope()}} or a
data frame which will be cast as such.}

\item{width}{Width in pixels of each panel.}

\item{height}{Height in pixels of each panel.}

\item{format}{The format of the image if it is not an htmlwidget. Can be
either "png" or "svg".}

\item{force}{Should the panels be forced to be written? If \code{FALSE}, the
content of the panel column along with the \code{width}, \code{height}, and
\code{format} parameters will be used to determine if the panel content matches
panels that have already been written, in which case writing the panels
will be skipped.}

\note{
The size of panels will vary when shown in the viewer, but here the
specification of height and width help determine the plot aspect ratio
as well as the initial resolution to render plot text, etc. with.
